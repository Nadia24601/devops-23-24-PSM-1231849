# CA4, Part 1 - Containers with Docker

### Create a new directory in the 'devops-23-24-PSM-1231820' package:

mkdir -p CA4/Part1


### Install the Docker Desktop application on your computer.

https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/


# Version 1

### Create the Dockerfile

Create a Dockerfile to execute the chat server using the work performed in the CA2/Part1.
This is based in the [Gradle Application](https://bitbucket.org/pssmatos/gradle_basic_demo/).
This file will define the environment and commands to build and run the chat server inside a Docker container.


Dockerfile
# Use a base image with JDK
FROM gradle:jdk21 as builder

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /usr/src/devops

# Copy the application source code to the container
ADD ./gradle_basic_demo.zip .

RUN unzip -q ./gradle_basic_demo.zip

# Change the working directory to the copied project directory
WORKDIR ./gradle_basic_demo

# Expose the port that the chat server listens on
EXPOSE 59001

# Build the chat server
RUN ./gradlew clean build

RUN ./gradle runServer


#### Build the Docker Image

Create a docker image with the server inside:

docker build --tag 'devops-part1-image' --file Dockerfile_V1 ../../

This has the following explanation:
- --tag 'devops-part1-image': Define the image tag name for easy access.
- --file Dockerfile: Docker file config identification.
  -../../: Directory that Docker will work with. We must include the parents parent folder to allow docker to get the CA2 content

#### Run the docker container
Run a docker container as follow

docker run --publish 59001:59001 devops-part1-image

This has the following explanation:
- run: instruction to run the image
- --detach: Detach the running container from the terminal (will run the container in background)
- --publish 59001:59001: Publish the port range between 59001:59001 to allow to stablish communication with the chart server
- devops-part1-image: The target image

#### To test the server

1. In another terminal, run the client app from CA2 Part 1 project:

Change path to the CA2/Part1/gradle_basic_demo:

cd <root>/CA2/Part1/gradle_basic_demo


2. Build the project to generate the build folder with the jar file:

./gradlew runClient


# Version 2

### Create the Dockerfile

Dockerfile
# Use a base image with JDK
FROM gradle:jdk21 AS builder

# Changes the working directory to the gradle_basic_demo
WORKDIR /usr/src/devops/

# Copy the gradle_basic_demo project to the container
COPY CA2/Part1/gradle_basic_demo/build/libs/basic_demo-0.1.0.jar basic_demo-0.1.0.jar

# Expose the port that the chat server listens on
EXPOSE 59001

# Run the chat server using a jar file
ENTRYPOINT ["java","-cp","./basic_demo-0.1.0.jar","basic_demo.ChatServerApp","59001"]


#### Build the Docker Image

Create a docker image with the server inside:

docker build --tag 'devops-part1_v2-image' --file Dockerfile_V2 ../../

This has the following explanation:
- --tag 'devops-part1-image': Define the image tag name for easy access.
- --file Dockerfile: Docker file config identification.
  -../../: Directory that Docker will work with. We must include the parents parent folder to allow docker to get the CA2 content

#### Run the docker container

Run a docker container as follow

docker run --publish 59001:59001 devops-part1_v2-image


#### Steps that can be performed after Version 1 or Version 2

### List running containers

To list all the docker containers running, can be used the terminal using the following instruction: docker ps -a.

-a: Option to list all containers (containers that are running and were stopped)

Another alternative is using the Docker Desktop app

### Stop a container

docker stop <container_id>: The container ID can be obtained using the docker ps command
Another alternative is using the Docker Desktop app

### Remove the docker container

docker rm <container_id>
Another alternative is using the Docker Desktop app

### Tagging the Repository

After completing the assignment, tag the repository with ca4-part1:

````
git tag ca4-part1
git push origin ca4-part1
````
