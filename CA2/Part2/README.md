# Spring Boot Project with React Frontend - Gradle Configuration

This project aims to convert the basic version of the Tutorial application to use Gradle as the build tool instead of Maven.

## Branch Creation and Initial Setup

1. **Create Branch:**

   Create a new branch named `tut-basic-gradle` in your repository and switch to this branch.

    ```
    git checkout -b tut-basic-gradle
    ```

2. **Project Setup:**

    - Navigate to the `CA2` directory in your local repository.
    - Create a directory named `Part2`.
    - Navigate to the `Part2` directory.
    - Generate a new Spring Boot project with  https://start.spring.io using the following configurations:
        - Project: Gradle-Groovy
        - Language: Java
        - Spring Boot: 3.2.4
        - Project Metadata:
            - Group: com.greglturnquist
            - Artifact: react-and-spring-data-rest-basic
            - Name: react-and-spring-data-rest-basic
            - Description: Demo project for Spring Boot
            - Package Name: com.greglturnquist.payroll
        - Packaging: Jar
        - Java: 17
        - Dependencies:
            - Rest Repositories
            - Thymeleaf
            - Spring Data JPA
            - H2 Database
    - Extract the contents of the generated zip file from `https://start.spring.io` into the `CA2/Part2/` folder. This provides the basic structure of a Spring application using Gradle.

## Gradle Configuration

1. **Delete src Folder:**

    ```
    rm -rf src
    ```

   Delete the `src` folder as it will be replaced with code from the basic tutorial.

2. **Copy Code from Basic Tutorial:**

    - Copy the `src` folder and all its subfolders from the basic tutorial into the `CA2/Part2/` folder.
    - Also, copy the `webpack.config.js` and `package.json` files.
    - Change the import in test  class from javax to jakarta.

3. **Update build.gradle:**

   Update the `build.gradle` file with the following configurations:

    ```
    plugins {
        id "org.siouan.frontend-jdk17" version "8.0.0"
    }

    frontend {
        nodeVersion = "16.20.2"
        assembleScript = "run build"
        cleanScript = "run clean"
        checkScript = "run check"
    }
    ```

4. **Update package.json:**

   Update the `package.json` file with the following scripts:

    ```
    "scripts": {
        "webpack": "webpack",
        "build": "npm run webpack",
        "check": "echo Checking frontend",
        "clean": "echo Cleaning frontend",
        "lint": "echo Linting frontend",
        "test": "echo Testing frontend"
    }
    ```

## Building and Running the Application

1. **Execute Gradle Tasks:**

   Execute the following command to build the project:

    ```
    ./gradlew build
    ```

2. **Run the Application:**

   Start the application using the following command:

    ```
    ./gradlew bootRun
    ```

## Additional Gradle Tasks

1. **Copy Generated JAR:**

   Add a task to copy the generated JAR to a folder named `dist` located at the project root level.
 ```
    task copyJar(type: Copy) {
        from 'build/libs'
        into 'dist'
        include '*.jar'
    }
 ```

Ensure this task is executed automatically by Gradle after the `build` task.

1. **Delete Webpack Files:**

   Add a task to delete all files generated by webpack (usually located at `src/main/resources/static/built/`). Ensure this task is executed automatically by Gradle before the `clean` task.
```
task deleteWebpack(type: Delete) {
    delete 'src/main/resources/static/built'
}
```

## Alternative Solutions with Ant 

# Ant Configuration

This project aims to convert the basic version of the Tutorial application to use Apache Ant as the build tool instead of Gradle.

## Ant Installation

1. Install Ant using marketplace or download the latest version from the official website: https://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi
2. Add Ant to the PATH environment variable.
3. Verify the installation by running the following command:

    ```
    ant -version
    ```

    The output should display the version of Ant installed on your system.
## Branch Creation and Initial Setup    

1. **Create Branch:**

   Create a new branch named `tut-basic-ant` in your repository and switch to this branch.

    ```
    git checkout -b tut-basic-ant
    ```
2. Copy the contents of the basic tutorial into the `CA2/Part2/` folder.

## Ant Configuration

create a build.xml file in the root of the project with the following content:
```
<project name="SpringBootReactAnt" default="build">

    <!-- Define properties -->
    <property name="dist.dir" value="${basedir}/dist"/>

    <!-- Define dependencies -->
    <!-- Define project structure -->

    <!-- Define tasks -->
    <target name="build" depends="compile, test, package, copyJar"/>

    <!-- Compile Java Code task -->
    <target name="compile">
        <!-- Add your compile task here -->
    </target>

    <!-- Run Tests task -->
    <target name="test">
        <!-- Add your test task here -->
    </target>

    <!-- Package Application task -->
    <target name="package">
        <!-- Add your package task here -->
    </target>

    <!-- Copy Generated JAR task -->
    <target name="copyJar">
        <copy file="build/libs/your_application.jar" todir="${dist.dir}"/>
    </target>
</project>
```
## Building and Running the Application

1. **Execute Ant Tasks:**

   Execute the following command to build the project:
    ```
    ant build
    ```
2. **Run the Application:**


3. Start the application using the following command:

    ```
    java -jar dist/your_application.jar
    ```
## Additional Ant Tasks

1. **Copy Generated JAR:**

   Add a task to copy the generated JAR to a folder named `dist` located at the project root level.
 ```
    <target name="copyJar">
        <copy file="build/libs/your_application.jar" todir="${dist.dir}"/>
    </target>
 ```

Ensure this task is executed automatically by Ant after the `build` task.

1. **Delete Webpack Files:**

   Add a task to delete all files generated by webpack (usually located at `src/main/resources/static/built/`). 
Ensure this task is executed automatically by Ant before the `clean` task.
```
<target name="deleteWebpack">
    <delete dir="${basedir}/src/main/resources/static/built"/>
</target>
```
## Conclusion
It was found Ant as a good alternative solution to Gradle. 

### Some of the differences between Gradle and Ant are as follows:

### Gradle:
- Is a Groovy-based build automation tool; 

- It uses DSL (Domain Specific Language) instead of XML (Extensible Markup Language) to define build scripts;

- Is developed to overcome the drawbacks of Maven and Ant;

- Plugins are coded in Java or Groovy programming language;

- Provides a structured build;

- Provides comfortable support for IDE integration;

- Is more standardized than Ant in case of flexibility;

- Supports multi-project build.

### Ant:
- Is a Java-based build automation tool;

- It uses XML files to determine build scripts;

- It is developed to overcome the drawbacks of the Make build tool of Unix;

- It does not impose any coding convention;

- It does not impose project structured;

- The IDE integration is slightly complex than maven;

- It is less flexible than Gradle;

- It does not support multi-project build;


In summary, Gradle offers a modern and flexible build automation solution with powerful features such as incremental builds and extensive plugin support. 
On the other hand, Apache Ant is known for its simplicity and platform independence, making it suitable for straightforward build processes, 
especially within the Java ecosystem.
